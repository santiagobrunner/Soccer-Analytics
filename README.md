# Soccer-Analytics
Project from the ETH course Soccer analytics in the spring semester 2023.

Course description:
"Soccer analytics refers to the use of data in tactical decision-making, recruitment, strategic planning, and fan engagement in association football. This course is first and foremost about data, problems, and methods. They are discussed, however, with reference to the broader context of measurement and data science in sports and society.

Students gain insight into the role of data science in professional football. They learn to capture aspects of the beautiful game in observable data to inform tactical, strategic, and communicative decision-making. By appreciating difficulties that arise even in activities with highly regulated interactions such as team sports, they reflect on the use of data science in the study of collective behavior."

Since the data comes directly from FIFA, it was not allowed to share it with third parties, which is why it is not provided here.
